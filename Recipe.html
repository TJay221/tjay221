     <h1><em>Kimchi Jjigae: My Beloved</em></h1>
<hr>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Now, I am <strong>not</strong> a good cook. I can only cook grilled cheese well, and even then I tend to burn it. But every home cook once burned toast and used bananas in pancake batter for <em>healthiness</em>. Cookies on the other hand, I am a master of cookies. But today I want to challenge myself. Allow me to practice new ways to horrify my stove and make my mother ashamed to call me her daughter.</p>
<p>
    <ruby>김치찌개 
        <rt>(kimchi jjigae)</rt>
    </ruby> 
    is a soup from Korea featuring one of the most common
    <ruby>반찬
        <rt>(banchan)
        </rt></ruby> or Korean side dish.
It may or may not be spicy, depending on type of kimchi and peppers used. It may also be vegetarian or vegan depending on kimchi and protein ingredients. For example: kimchi used can include fish sauce and/or shell fish, or can use other ingredients. While I use tuna in my kimchi jjigae, you can use tofu or any other protein such as pork or beef.

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>In my <a href=intro.html> Intro</a> page, I talked about how I currently live in Korea. This, however, does <em>NOT</em> make me any sort of spokesperson on Korea or Korean culture and food. Here are some other links for more information. <a href=mailto:jtgrote@Quinnipiac.edu> Email Me </a> if you know have favorite resources for Korean culture.
