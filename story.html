<h1>Overactive Thoughts Of Selecting a Fruit</h1>
<hr>
<p>It's been twenty minutes! At least it was all downhill, it's too hot this September. I need something  for the peanut butter idly sitting on my kitchen shelf. Peanut butter is expensive and cannot be wasted on an uneventful flavor journey. At least the market is bustling today.</p>
<p>On the left, kiwi. Peanut butter does not pair well with kiwi <em>at all.</em><br><br>
Next to the kiwi, bananas, my mortal enemy. <del> Bananas are THE food to destroy humanity. Its taste, horrific. Its texture, like a mushy nail on a velvetty chalkboard. The smell, nauseating. Society's prolific love for the prolific 'fruit' shall forever curse me, taunt me, around the globe.
</del> <ins><strong>They will never enter my kitchen.</strong></ins><br><br>
The box above the <s>foul</s> bananas... Pears! Pears are nice. Their sweetness <em>pairs</em> well with the saltiness of peanut butter. But the price tag! It is simply too high. Pears would turn a simple snack into an expensive, gourmet appetizer.<br><br>
Onto the next fruit, hopefully something here is fitting! 단감(dan gam), the sign says. <dfn>감(gam)</dfn> is Korean for persimmon, a sweet fruit. It really does look like a tomato. It only looks like a tomato though. It is like a cinnamon-y apple with a hint of pumpkin, this might bode well for peanut butter. Is it persimmon season already? I wanted my peanut butter journey today to be a gauranteed delicacy. But I cannot help but test the waters with my favorite fall fruit.</p>

<h2>Today, we will choose 단감.</h2>
<p>I only hope it is worth the long walk back.</p>
