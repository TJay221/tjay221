        <h2>What is NEIS?</h2>
        <p>NEIS (the National Education Information System) is what all school staff and faculty use for a variety of purposes. Parents and students even use NEIS. Those of us familiar with PowerSchool… think of PowerSchool on steroids.</p>
        <p>NETs typically only use NEIS for logging our personal time, sick time, and business trips as well as checking our paystubs (if your school uploads it).</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>*NOTE: Your Coteacher needs to contact your school's admin or IT department to set a certificate before you can enter NEIS. SOME CoTs believe NETs have no reason to use NEIS because CoTs can submit our trips. They are incorrect and need to fix themselves.</p>
