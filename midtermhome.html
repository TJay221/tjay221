     <h2>Summary</h2>
     <p>In our job as Native English Teachers in the Republic of Korea, a lot of orientation training focuses on nunchi, interacting with Korean culture and coworkers, but I'd like to introduce the concept of NETchi. Sometimes the focus on interacting with Korea overshadows the concept of how we actually handle working as Native English Teachers. The purpose of this website is to bridge the gap between you and your work environment to help <em>YOU</em> thrive individually.</p><br>

     <p><strong>Midterm Sidebar:</strong> The pages in this website are meant to simplify content but still offer options to the learners. You'll notice on 'Watermarking' that users will have two options to weigh based on their concern over their work and their familiarity with PowerPoint. Users can choose to skip to their choice or skim both. The learners are adults working in a language they are not competent in, so giving them a sense of authority over their work is very important to this website along with non-condecending simplicity. Each module added to the website will have the intention to give scaffolding via options: If learners are comfortable with the simple method, they can <em>choose</em> to engage with more difficult options.</p>
     <p>The text is broken up using visual images and a bit of spacing. I hope to be able to arange the text to be better lined with the images to support them as well as add a bit of interactivity and/or mini-slideshows so more images can be added to the page without adding clutter to the screen.</p>
